            <h2 class="title-3">OUR MISSION?</h2>
            <p class="p-1">To make lives better through education. An innovative Philippine business institution, PHINMA always looks for ways to help Filipinos attain better lives. In 2004, they realized that investing in education was key to fully accomplishing their mission.<br><br>Overall enrollment figures in the country have always been high. Despite this, attrition rates remained high and consistent. Out of four students who enter first grade, only one will go on to finish a tertiary degree. Learning about these statistics led PHINMA’s leaders to realize that they could fulfill their mission by helping improve the country’s state of education. With this in mind, they entered the education field to introduce reforms and innovations. In 2004, PHINMA Education was born.</p>
